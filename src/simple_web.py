            - Designate a timekeeper.

            **2. 🗺️ The Landscape (5 mins)**
            - Each player chooses a book section they will "guide."
            - Everyone takes 5 minutes to read the enriched Table of Contents for *their chosen section*.

            **3. 🔄 Playing the Sections (The Core Loop)**
            - The section's guide reads its "Section Card" aloud.
            - Distribute all cards for that section.
            - Players discuss and place their cards on the table, drawing connections.
            - At the end of the section, the guide tells the story in **one minute sharp**.

            **4. 🏆 The Grand Finale**
            - After the final section, the most courageous person tells the story of the *entire book*.
            - Remember to take a picture of your beautiful creation! ✨
