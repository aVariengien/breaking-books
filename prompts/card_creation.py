CARD_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
# Instruction
You are reading a long section of a book. You role is to create {NB_CARD} Zettelkasten cards containing the key ideas from the content of this section. Every cards has a title, a description, an illustration and an ensemble of quotes containing, supporting or embodying the idea. 

Ensure the cards cover _all_ the content from this section. If I were to use the cards in a slide show to present the section to an audience, I could use the cards as a slide show to tell the complete story of the section without loosing much details.

## Guidelines:
1. Each card should represent ONE distinct, atomic idea from the text
2. Ensure cards collectively cover the COMPLETE content of the section
3. Use clear, precise language in the descriptions. Make use of bold HTML <b> tag for emphasis.
4. Create simple, precise descriptions of PHOTOGRAPHIC illustration that gives understanding of the idea at first glance.
5. The illustration should be of a scene or a situation that is representative of the idea, there should be NO LABEL, NO DIAGRAM and NO TEXT
6. Extract 1 to 5 direct quotes that best exemplify each idea. Ensure quotes are full sentences that can be read as stand alone.
7. Include ideas that are not directly named in the text but are present, scattered or diffused accross the text
8. Include counterintuitive or surprising elements when present in the text

## Output Format:
The cards should be usable as:
- A standalone reference to an idea
- A sequential slide deck that tells the full narrative of the section
- A network of interconnected ideas that maintains the author's original meaning
