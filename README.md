# Breaking Books

Turn any book into a collaborative, hands-on learning game.

## üåç A New Way to Read Together

Breaking Books is a system for turning non-fiction books into physical card games. It transforms the solitary act of reading into an active, shared experience.

It's more than a tool‚Äîit's a social practice. The goal is to create a space for people to learn actively, build shared understanding, and connect with each other, away from screens.

The project is inspired by *arpentage*, a 19th-century practice where French workers would physically break apart books. Each person would read a section and then meet to teach the others. In the same spirit, Breaking Books deconstructs a book so a group can rebuild its ideas together.

## üé≤ The Game: How It Works

The tool generates a single printable PDF containing the game materials:

1.  An **Enriched Table of Contents** with chapter summaries and key quotes, serving as your map for the journey.
2.  A deck of **Illustrated Cards**, each representing a core concept or a telling example from the book. The visuals help anchor the ideas, while quotes provide a direct line to the author's voice.

### A Simple Guide to Your First Game

This is one way to play. Remember to adapt it and make it your own.

**1. üëã Welcome & Setup (10-15 mins)**
-   Gather your group (3-5 people is ideal). Cover a large table with a sheet of paper to create your canvas.
-   Start with a welcome roundup: Why is everyone here? What's your interest in the book? What's your background on the topic?
-   Designate a timekeeper to help the game flow and protect time for discussion at the end.

**2. üó∫Ô∏è The Landscape (5 mins)**
-   Each player chooses a book section they will "guide."
-   Everyone takes 5 minutes to read the enriched Table of Contents for *their chosen section*. This gives each guide a bit more context.

**3. üîÑ Playing the Sections (The Core Loop)**
The game proceeds section by section. For each one:
-   The section's guide reads its "Section Card" aloud to introduce the theme.
-   Distribute all cards for that section among the players.
-   Players discuss and place their cards on the paper canvas, grouping them and drawing connections to make sense of the ideas.
-   At the end of the section, the guide tells the story of what you've built in **one minute sharp**.

**4. üèÜ The Grand Finale**
-   After the final section, the most courageous person tells the story of the *entire book* using the complete visual map.
-   Leave plenty of time for the open discussion that will follow!
-   Remember to take a picture of your beautiful creation! ‚ú®

Success isn't winning; it's a great conversation and a new, shared perspective.

## üí° The Project

This project was born during a hackathon, from a desire to explore new ways of interacting with books. Our next step is to play more games and gather feedback from people like you.

If you play a game, we would love to hear your story, feedback, or ideas. Please get in touch.

### Acknowledgements

- A special thank you to **Nia** and **Felix** for playtesting the very first game.
